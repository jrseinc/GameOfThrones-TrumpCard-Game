4.  Once the attacker chooses their ability, the values will be compared between the two cards with respect to the same ability. And the fate of the cards will be decided based on the game mode. In case of a draw both cards will be discarded from the match regardless of match type.
    
5.  If the attacker loses a particular round, they will switch sides and become defenders in the next round, Otherwise they will continue with the attacking position.
    
6.  There will be a Special Card: The Night King Card which will cause the opponent to lose 3 cards instantly, regardless of the Night King being a defender or attacker. But if the opponent facing the card is Arya Stark then the Night King along with 2 other cards will be removed.
